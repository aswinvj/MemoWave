Instructions for Spiderclaw V2 adapted to OpenBCI board V3.

1) Assembling the printed parts of headware :
   (Warning : For a better assembling, connect the battery cable to the OpenBCI board at the beginning).
- for the top of the Headware_Body.STL = Two M3 Allen Bolt Cap Screws Hex (2,5 cm length) + two M3 Nylock Nuts
- for the bottom of the Headware_Body.STL (BatteryHolder attached) = Two M3 Allen Bolt Cap Screws Hex (3 cm length cut to 2,8cm) + two M3 Nylock Nuts

2) Parts holding the Spiderclaw's arms to your head :
- for the two lateral Headware_arm_end_belt.STL = a car strap that you cut at your desired length for your forehead.
  (The width of the strap will be ideally less than 3 cm to pass thru the hole of the 2 Headware_arm_end_belt.STL.
  You attached the fabric with staples).
- for the three Headware_arm_end.STL parts = three elastic bands
- for the arm_segment_long.STL + arm_segment_medium.STL + arm_segment_short.STL = fishing line (ultra-strong braided Spectra Fiber)
